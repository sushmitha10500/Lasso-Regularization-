# Overfitting is the very common issue in the field of ML, L1 and L2 regularizations are some of the techniques that can be used to address overfitting issue
# Regularization is a technique used to reduce errors by fitting the function appropriately on the given training set and avoiding overfitting. The commonly used regularization techniques are: 

1)LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression L1 Regularization.
2)RIDGE (Regularization Improves the Durability of the Generalized Estimates) L2 Regularization.
